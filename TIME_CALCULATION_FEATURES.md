# Time Calculation Features for Campus Navigation

## Overview
The campus navigation platform now includes advanced time calculation features that provide comprehensive travel time estimates between campus locations. This system considers multiple factors to give users accurate and helpful travel information.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Modal Transportation Times
The system calculates travel times for different transportation modes:

- **Walking**: Standard walking pace (5 km/h)
- **Running**: Jogging pace (12 km/h)
- **Cycling**: Bicycle travel (15 km/h)
- **Wheelchair**: Accessible route travel (4 km/h)

### 2. Smart Time Factors
The calculation system considers various real-world factors:

#### Time of Day Factors
- **Morning (8-10 AM)**: 1.1x multiplier (more crowded)
- **Afternoon (10 AM-4 PM)**: 1.0x multiplier (normal)
- **Evening (4-6 PM)**: 1.15x multiplier (rush hour)
- **Night (6 PM-8 AM)**: 0.9x multiplier (less crowded)

#### Terrain Factors
- **Academic Areas**: 1.0x (normal walking paths)
- **Dining Areas**: 1.0x (normal walking paths)
- **Hostel Areas**: 1.1x (slightly hilly)
- **Recreation Areas**: 1.2x (more obstacles)
- **Admin Areas**: 1.0x (normal walking paths)
- **Medical Areas**: 1.0x (normal walking paths)

### 3. Enhanced User Interface

#### Desktop Layout
- **Sidebar Panel**: Dedicated time calculator panel on the right side
- **Real-time Updates**: Time calculations update automatically when locations change
- **Comprehensive Information**: Shows distance, duration, and estimated arrival times

#### Mobile Layout
- **Bottom Panel**: Fixed bottom panel for mobile devices
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for touch interactions
- **Collapsible Interface**: Space-efficient design for small screens

### 4. Time Calculator Components

#### Route Information Card
- Start and destination locations
- Distance calculation
- Current time and day period
- Location categories with badges

#### Travel Options Grid
- Four transportation modes with icons
- Duration and arrival time for each mode
- Color-coded icons for easy identification
- Hover effects for better UX

#### Smart Recommendations
- Context-aware suggestions based on:
  - Travel distance (long walks vs. short walks)
  - Time of day (rush hour warnings)
  - Weather considerations (future enhancement)
  - Accessibility needs

#### Quick Actions
- Set reminders for travel
- Save favorite routes
- Start navigation mode

## Technical Implementation

### Core Files

### Calculation Algorithm

```typescript
// Base calculation formula
const travelTime = (distance / speed) * terrainFactor * timeFactor * accessibilityFactor

// Where:
// - distance: Calculated using Haversine formula
// - speed: Transportation mode speed (km/h)
// - terrainFactor: Based on destination category
// - timeFactor: Based on current time of day
// - accessibilityFactor: Additional factor for wheelchair users
```

### Coordinate System
- Converts campus coordinate system to lat/lng for accurate calculations
- Uses MUJ campus center (26.8431, 75.5647) as reference point
- Scales relative coordinates for realistic distances

## User Experience Features

### Real-time Updates
- Current time display with automatic updates
- Live arrival time calculations
- Dynamic recommendations based on time of day

### Accessibility
- Wheelchair-accessible route calculations
- High contrast color schemes
- Screen reader friendly interface
- Touch-optimized mobile interface

### Smart Notifications
- Rush hour warnings
- Long distance travel alerts
- Quick walk confirmations
- Night time safety reminders

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Weather Integration**: Adjust times based on weather conditions
2. **Crowd Density**: Real-time crowd level adjustments
3. **Event-based Routing**: Avoid crowded areas during events
4. **Personalized Speeds**: User-specific walking/running speeds
5. **Indoor Navigation**: Time calculations for indoor spaces
6. **Public Transport**: Integration with campus shuttle times

### API Extensions
1. **Real-time Data**: Live updates from campus sensors
2. **Historical Data**: Time patterns based on historical data
3. **Machine Learning**: Predictive time calculations
4. **Social Features**: User-reported travel times

## Usage Examples

### Basic Time Calculation
```typescript
const calculation = calculateTimeBetweenLocations(startLocation, endLocation);
console.log(`Walking time: ${calculation.formattedWalkingTime}`);
console.log(`Arrival time: ${calculation.estimatedArrival.walking}`);
```

### Multi-point Route
```typescript
const multiPointCalculation = calculateMultiPointTime([loc1, loc2, loc3]);
console.log(`Total walking time: ${multiPointCalculation.formattedWalkingTime}`);
```

### Smart Recommendations
```typescript
const recommendations = getTimeRecommendations(calculation);
recommendations.forEach(rec => console.log(`- ${rec}`));
```

## Configuration

### Speed Adjustments
Modify transportation speeds in `time-calculator.ts`:
```typescript
const SPEEDS = {
  walking: 5,    // km/h
  running: 12,   // km/h
  cycling: 15,   // km/h
  wheelchair: 4, // km/h
};
```

### Time Factors
Adjust time of day multipliers:
```typescript
const TIME_FACTORS = {
  morning: 1.1,   // 10% slower
  afternoon: 1.0, // normal speed
  evening: 1.15,  // 15% slower
  night: 0.9,     // 10% faster
};
```

### Terrain Factors
Modify terrain difficulty:
```typescript
const TERRAIN_FACTORS = {
  academic: 1.0,   // normal
  hostels: 1.1,    // slightly harder
  recreation: 1.2, // more obstacles
  // ... other categories
};
```

## Performance Considerations
